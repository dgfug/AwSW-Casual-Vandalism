# AwSW Casual Vandalism

This isnt supposed to be a proper AwSW mod, it was more me seeing if I was able to mod, so dont expect anything amazing.

The basic idea is that the first part of Lorems 3rd date is changed.
(Assuming the mod is working properly) It should start when the MC and Lorem start walking to the school area for the tresure hunt.
There will be two options, picking one will change one of the later sceans and the other will have the normal route.
If you picked the option that changes the route you should pick "Look inside the windows." and you will have another two options with diffrent dialoge.
I was planning on adding certain characters commenting on your choises later, but thats not in this version.

This needs Magmalink to work, which can be found here: https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink

Also huge thanks to Jakzie for their help, they're the reason this actually works and isnt just error screen after error screen.
